# Spring-Boot-Asynchronous-API
[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=Raouf25_spring-boot-asynchronous-api&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Raouf25_spring-boot-asynchronous-api)


## Overview
This project is a sample of an asynchronous API built in Spring Boot. It provides asynchronous endpoints that are called asynchronously and can be used as a starting point to build more complex systems.

## Prerequisites
* Java 8
* Maven 3.3.9
* Spring Boot 2.1.3

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raouf25/spring-boot-asynchronous-api.git
```
Once you've cloned the project, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Once the server is up and running, you can access the web service at http://localhost:8080/.
 

## Github Actions
Github Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows developers to automate their workflow with custom scripts. This project contains a Github Action workflow that executes the following steps:

1. Checkout the source code
2. Build the application
3. Run unit & integration tests
   - âœ… [code coverage in sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=Raouf25_spring-boot-asynchronous-api)
4. Deploy in Dev environment
5. Run non regression tests
6. Publish the generated reports
   - âœ… [karate report]( https://raouf25.github.io/spring-boot-asynchronous-api/karate-summary.html )
   
The workflow also runs non-regression tests as part of the build process. The reports are published to the `reports` directory and can be accessed from the Github Actions UI. The reports can also be generated locally using the `mvn test` command.

2. âœ… Non Regression Test:  [karate report]( https://raouf25.github.io/spring-boot-asynchronous-api/karate-summary.html )
3. âœ… Code coverage (sonar & jacoco)
4. ðŸš§ CICD releasing 

## how run nrt locally:
```shell
 mvn clean test -DskipTests=false -Dapi.url=http://localhost:8080 
```

## Maven release
steps: 
- checkout code from repository
- get actual version 
- push image in docker 
- deploy 
- generate changelog 
- bump version in main branch 

1. increase version
```shell
mvn -q build-helper:parse-version versions:set -DnewVersion=\${parsedVersion.majorVersion}.\${parsedVersion.nextMinorVersion}.0 versions::commit
```
